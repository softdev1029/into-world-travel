    <Text>This traditional hotel is located just minutes away from Knightsbridge and Kings Road. All bedrooms have the same d√©cor and furnishing and are rather compact. Each room has a private bathroom, TV, hairdryer, safe, trouser press and tea/coffee making facilities. The public areas are very pleasant. All 5 floors are covered by 2 separate lifts. There is a wine bar, a traditional pub and an attractive restaurant in classic style, all designed to offer the guest a relaxing evening after the rigours of the day.</Text>
