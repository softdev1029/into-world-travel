Hotel is a newly-opened hotel in the Sultanahmet section of the Old City of Constantinople, which was renamed Istanbul in 1923 when the Ottoman Empire came to an end with the establishment of the modern state of Turkey. As the capital of three successive empires, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman, Istanbul has long occupied a central role in the histories and cultures of the Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans, in succession and is today one of the largest, most vibrant and undeniably cosmopolitan cities in the world. The Basileus's location in the Sultanahmet section provides ease of access on foot to a host of Istanbul's most important and historic tourist attractions, among them being Justinian's 6th century C.E. masterpiece the Haghia Sophia (Ayasofya Camii), the Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet Camii), the Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace, the Hippodrome, the Basilica Cistern, the Turkish and Islamic Museum, the Archaeological Museum, as well as numerous historic Ottoman baths known as ha-mams. Also located within just minutes of Basileus's front doors is the extraordinary little Byzantine Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, also built by the Emperor Justinian and his Empress Theodora, now known as Kucuk Ayasofya ("Little Ayasofya"), which served as an architectural forerunner to the later Ayasofya in a number of its innovative architectural elements. Hotel's name "basileus" is Greek for "king" and was one of the imperial tiles used by Justinian-a fitting name for hotel located in this district containing several of his residences and churches! Other sections of the surrounding neighborhood once served as an important harbor in Byzantine times and as parts of the massive imperial palace complex of the Palace of the Caesars during the early Roman era. Virtually everywhere you go in Sultanahmet reflects this layering of successive civilizations and the immediate vicinity of Basileus proves no exception to that rule. Step outside and walk around. Ancient Istanbul is ready to welcome you.</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>SurroundingArea</Type><Text>Basileus hotel is located in old-city Sultanahmet area.
