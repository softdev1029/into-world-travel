<p>In order to travel into, or through, Belarus for any reason it is necessary to apply for a Visa. There are four main kinds of Visa available - namely <a href="belarus_tourist_visa.php">Tourist</a>, <a href="belarus_business_visa.php">Business</a>, <a href="belarus_private_visa.php">Visitor</a> and <a href="belarus_transit_visa.php">Transit</a>. Please select the relevant option from the left-hand menu on this page for more information on applying for these and the costs involved.</p>
<p><strong>Visa application forms for Belarus</strong> can be obtained online by <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.by/docs/visa_forms/english.pdf" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. This form may be printed off and handwritten. Two copies of the completed form should be sent to IntoRussia along with any other required <strong>supporting documents</strong>.
