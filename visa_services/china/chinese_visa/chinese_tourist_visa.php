<p>All travellers to China require a tourist visa. There are single and double entry visas available. 
You will need a double entry <strong>Chinese Tourist Visa</strong> for example if you wish to exit China to visit Hong Kong before 
travelling back into China.</p>
<p> A single entry tourist visa for China is valid for 3 months, and a double entry visa valid for 
6 months, both for a maximum of 30 days and cannot be extended. The Tourist visa is suitable for visitors 
that know where, and for how long their will stay in the country. </p>
<p>What we need from you:</p>
<ul><li>Passport
</li><li>Signed Chinese visa application form
</li><li>One passport size Photograph
</li><li>Visa support documents, only if you have not booked your holiday with IntoRussia</li></ul>

<h2>Chinese Tourist Visa Support Documents</h2>
<p>In order to get a Chinese Tourist Visa you have to provide visa support documents 
(including return tickets and confirmed accommodation for every night of your stay in China). 
If you are on a private visit your visa support documents may be an invitation letter from
 a permanent resident in China or a Chinese organization instead of train tickets and hotel booking.  </p>
 <p>
If you book your holiday with us the <strong>visa support documents</strong> for tourist visas will be included. However, 
if our other services are not required, we can also just arrange the visa support documents for you. 
Prices and processing time can be found below.
