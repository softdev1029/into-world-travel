<p>A Tourist Visa allows travellers to visit Uzbekistan as tourists, for a maximum of 30 days. There are single entry and multiple entry visas available. This type of Visa is suitable for travellers who know where, and for how long, they will stay in the country. You would need a multiple entry Tourist Visa if, for example, you travelled on a tour or train journey which travels through Uzbekistan and back again.</p>
