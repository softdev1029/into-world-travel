<p>In order to travel into, or through, Uzbekistan for any reason it is necessary to apply for a Visa. There are four main kinds of Visa available - namely <a href="uzbek_tourist_visa.php">Tourist</a>, <a href="uzbek_business_visa.php">Business</a>, <a href="uzbek_private_visa.php">Private</a> and <a href="uzbek_transit_visa.php">Transit</a>. Please select the relevant option from the left-hand menu on this page for more information on applying for these and the costs involved.</p>
<p>Visa application forms for Uzbekistan  can be obtained online by <a href="http://www.uzbekembassy.org/e/visa_application_form/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.
