<h2>IntoRussia offers a new Russian Passport Renewal Service as part of its Visa services</h2>

Russia to renew your Foreign Passport or you can simply visit the Russian Embassy for your passport renewal.
 If you are busy or do not enjoy queuing at the Russian Embassy, our New <strong>Russian Passport Renewal Service</strong> provides an easy escape for you!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fill out your Passport Renewal Application</li>
  <li>Book an appointment for you to apply for a New Russian Foreign Passport at the Russian Embassy. </li>
  <li>Offer advice on the documents needed to accompany your Passport Renewal application</li>

<h2>New Russian Passport Collection following Renewal</h2>
<p>We would love to send and collect your new Russian Passport for you, but unfortunately Russian Embassy Policy does not allow us to do so.</p>
<p>You will need to <strong>apply and collect your new Russian Passport</strong> in person at the Russian Embassy. 
On the plus side there is no need to book an appointment to collect your new Russian Passport after its renewal. 
But it is essential that you bring your current Russian Passport with you. 
If your current Russian Passport has expired then you should also bring your Russian National passport with you.</p>
<p>A Russian Embassy case-worker will hand you your new Russian Passport, mark your current Russian Passport as 
invalid and return your current Russian Passport to you. </p>
<p>The Russian embassy address is 5 Kensington Palace Gardens, London, W8 4QS. <br/>
Russian Passports can be collected at the following times:</p>
