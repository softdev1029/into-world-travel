<p>You are required to obtain an <strong>Invitation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</strong> for Business and Private <strong>Russian visas</strong>.</p>
<p>You need not worry about obtaining an Invitation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs if you are applying for <strong>Tourist or Transit Russian visas</strong>. 
However, you will still need a <strong>Russian visa invitation</strong>, and this must be provided by eligible travel agencies and/or hotels. </p>
<p>IntoRussia offers <strong>Russian visa invitations</strong> and <strong>visa support documents</strong> for all visa types. If you book your holiday with us, these documents will be included automatically.</p>
<p>If our other services are not required, we can also arrange just the Invitation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for business visas or visa support documents & invitation letter for tourist visas. Prices and processing times can be found on our specific visa type pages.</p>

IntoRussia is a non-governmental organisation and the services we offer include providing assistance in obtaining a visa to Russia in a timely and efficient manner by checking documentation, ensuring paperwork is completed correctly and by delivering and collecting documents on the client's behalf.
Please note that we have no direct influence on the outcome of the application nor the visa processing time. These are determined only by the Consulate Section of the Embassy and they reserve the right to delay your application or require additional documents at any time.
