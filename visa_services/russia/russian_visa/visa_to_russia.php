<p>All visitors to Russia require a valid <strong>Russian travel visa</strong>. The granting of a visa to enter Russia is a legal requirement at the discretion of the Russian Consulate.  
</p>
<h2>Types of Visa</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="russian_tourist_visa.php">Tourist Visa &#45; for general Tourists</a></li>
<li><a href="russian_business_visa.php">Business Visa &#45; for Business Travellers</a></li>
<li><a href="russian_private_visa.php">Private Visa &#45; for Private Visitors</a></li>
<li><a href="russian_transit_visa.php">Transit Visa &#45; for those passing through Russia on their way to other countries</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of which type of visa you require, you can apply for <strong>Single Entry</strong> or <strong>Double Entry</strong>. Only the Business visa allows you multiple entries to the country.</p>

<h2>The Application Process</h2>
<p>The process of applying for a Russian visa can be complicated and even a small mistake can lead to your application being declined, making travel to Russia impossible. By arranging this through IntoRussia we can offer you peace of mind, as we will make sure that the application form is filled out correctly according to all legal requirements and that there will be no problems with the further process.</p>

<h2>Russian Visa Invitation</h2>
<p>All travellers to Russia require an <strong>Invitation for a Russian visa</strong>. This could be a simple visa support letter from a hotel, however for business and private visas it is required to obtain an Invitation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Please find more information about this process on our <a href="/visa_services/russia/russian_visa/invitation_letter/russian_visa_support_documents.php">Russian Visa Invitation</a> page.</p>
<p><b>Even if you have arranged your Visa elsewhere, IntoRussia can offer the invitation alone for a fee of Â£35.00.</b></p>

<h2>Russian Visa Support documents</h2>
<p>To process the your Russian visa application, we will require the following documents from you: </p>
<ul>
<li>Original passport</li>
<li>Completed visa application form</li>
<li>One passport sized photograph</li>
<li>Russian visa support letter/Letter of invitation</li>
</ul>
<p>More information about the required supporting documents for different types of visa are specified on the relevant pages.</p>

<h2>Office of Visas and Registration</h2>
<p>Further to receiving your visa, after you enter Russia you must acquire Registration of Foreigners paperwork at an OVIR office (Office of Visas and Registration). Getting these documents within the first 72 hours of your travel to Russia is a legal requirement. Travellers that stay in hotels do not have to register because the hotel will register them. If not, please find more information about our new visa service on our <a href="/visa_services/russia/russian_visa/registration_service/registration_in_russia.php">Russian Registration Service</a> page.</p>
