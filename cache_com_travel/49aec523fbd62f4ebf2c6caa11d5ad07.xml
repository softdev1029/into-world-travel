Visitors can admire majestic mosques and many heritage sites and museums, as well as shop at traditional markets (souks) and modern retail malls. A visit to Sharjah is incomplete without browsing the Central Souk, a major landmark famous for its many gold and jewelry dealers. Spend a charming holiday by strolling around lagoons and experiencing the natural beauty of Arabian deserts, Al Hajar Mountains, and beaches. The many attractions of Dubai are only 30 minutes away.</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>PropertyInformation</Type><Text>null</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>DiningFacilities</Type><Text>Sheraton Sharjah offers an exciting array of tastes to suit every palate. Start your day with a Sheraton breakfast at Gusti, which then transforms into a casual contemporary Italian dinner venue. Throughout the day Al Qubtan at the beach beckons with popular grilled classics whilst the pool bar will ensure you stay hydrated. Be spoilt for choice at dinner. We are proud to present Saba, the first truly Emirati restaurant in the emirate with regional specialties in an indoor as well as al fresco setting, whilst the Seafood Market restaurant serves the freshest Gulf and other seafood from the market stalls located right inside the restaurant. For the moments in between and to connect with friends and family the Link@Sheraton Cafe is the perfect venue. Al Mahattah Cigar &amp; Coffee Lounge is the elegant venue for pre or post dinner relaxation or to savor an aromatic cigar whilst watching the sun set in the Gulf.</Text></Description><Description><Language>en</Language><Type>Short</Type><Text>null</Text></Description><Rating><System>Stars</System><Score>50</Score><Description>Five
